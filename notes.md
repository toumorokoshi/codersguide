# Topics I want to cover

* the upper bound of shipping due to a test cycle.
* to keep coverage as low level as possible, for more testing.

There's a lot of ideas intertwined here, and they need to be petered out into sections:

* the fact that fast tests can be run a lot more often than slow tests
* the fact that running tests faster gives feedback faster (thereby
  increasing the value of the test)
* that tests are a matter of a cost
* testing is a matter of risk
  * the cost of the test should be cheaper than the cost to the business to have
    the feature fail.
