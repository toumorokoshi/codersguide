As you continue to move forward in your career, you’ll find there’s limits to what a single person can do. Being a more experienced engineer and being a leader means identifying how to improve things as a team, and sometimes that means being able to give critical feedback that is not positive.

That said, being a successful leader is not about giving feedback, it’s about how you give it. If you feel that someone has areas to improve, how can you share that in such a way where the person doesn’t feel attacked? Does it make more sense to use a different, more subtle method, such as automating the check? Remember that sometimes the solution might be human process, or it might be code. Be open to both options.
