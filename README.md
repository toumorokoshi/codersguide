# The Coder's Guide to ... Something

This is one person's thoughts on Software Engineering, and how I think it
should work.

I've read a lot of ideas across software engineering. The ones that
have strong support from studies, or follow well-reasoned logic, I add
to this book.

There are some ideas I like, mainly because it resonates with
me. Since these are not backed up by evidence, I put them in the
pinion section until it meets or fails the same rigor as the other
sections.

Many of these ideas are not mine. Some are. I'll point to the source
if I got it from one.

Any and all of these ideas are up for scrutiny. If you disagree and a
factual or logical basis, I'd love to hear from you: file an issue, or
PR.

You can file issus about your opinions too, but facts and logic win
out.
