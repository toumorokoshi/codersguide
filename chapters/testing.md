# Testing

- instability estimate of full-stack tests.
- testing pyramid
- testing feedback loop

## TLDR

- as many unit tests as possible
- as few integration tests and full-stack tests as possible
- code coverage isn't a perfect metric of defect detection. Test count is better.

## The Details

### What do we want from tests?

The most valuable tests provide the most coverage
for the smallest developer cost.

as of 2016, hardware is relatively cheap (ELABORATE)
