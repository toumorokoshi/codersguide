A library system is a great example\nof a system that helps make discover easy; even with millions of potential\nentries, the tree itself is only 2 levels deep.\nThere's a strong corallary with code: when attempting to find or if\nfunctionality, or find where it is located, a very large, flat index\nhelps.\nRule of thumb is to not make a hierarchy more than four levels deep:\n\n\nlayer of abstraction (client / internal / datasource / core)\n\n\n\nfunction\n\n\n\nsupporting functionality\n\n\n\nThis is typically enough to scale a codebase.\n~ 100 LOC per module\nPython is already a concise language, so your module probably\nshouldn't baloon much anyway. But if they do, start to refactor\nyour code into multiple functions, then move those into multiple modules.\nRefactoring into multiple functions\nA function often becomes bloated because it is attempting to manage\ntoo many low-level details in a single function. The\nextract method\nis a great pattern for this case: it ensures it's possible to keep\ncontext on what the function is doing, without including the detailed\ncode itself.\nExtract method comes with another advantage: it helps clarify the\ncode, because code that represents the behaviour you expect is clearly\nlableed and encapsulated.\nPut the main function at the top, subfunctions in first-seen order.\nMany developers have learned to read code regardless of the\norganization, but wouldnt't it be great to read code like a well written essay? A well\nwritten essay has:\n\nhigh level context at the beginning\nintroduces each concept in order of mention from the high level context.\n\nPutting the main functionality of the module at the top means the\nreader is presented with the most important information immediately:\nwhat this function does, and high-level instructions on how it's doing\nit. Putting the used subfunctions in order of first mention mean I can\nimmediately follow along with the individual function flow, by reading\ntop down. The low-level details are provided at the bottom.\n"},"opinion/project_management.html":{"url":"opinion/project_management.html","title":"Project Management","keywords":"","body":"Project Planning\nMy opinions on project planning.\nShort and Sweet\n\ndefine a project (the smaller the better)\ndefine how you measure success\ntask the project in small, logical steps to execution\nexecute those steps\n\nIn Detail\n1. Defining a Project\nOnly 1 / 3rd of customer facing projects have the desired effect. Many\nend up not moving any KPI toward a positive direction, and that means\nwasted work. Thus, if there's any part of the development process to\noptimize, it's choosing which projects to invest time in.\nThe lean startup and agile suggest defining the absolute bare minimum\nnecessary to prove value of larger investments.\n\n\"good to great\" notes that iterating faster is the only way to find your hedgehog faster\nlean startup also pushes iteration\n\nDefining Small Projects\nStrip all Unnescessary Pieces\nIf the value of the feature itself is not clear, it's best to shave\noff anything that is required for the feature to provide value.\nExamples include:\n\naesthetics (color scheme / font)\nusability (button layout, etc)\nquality (heavy testing scenarios)\n\nThat's not to say these parts aren't important: they just shouldn't be\nthe first optimizations after value is established.\nFake it\nThe whole product does need to be built to provide and validate value\nto users. When selling a new product, you can see if there's demand by\nbuying and selling items off the shelf retail, and taking a loss.\n2. Measuring Success\nSuccess is measurable. If a project is being worked on that doesn't\nmove KPIs that someone cares about, then there are more important\nprojects to work on.\nA common argument is \"but my project doesn't affect the customer!\". If\nthat's the case, you may be looking at the wrong customer.\nE.g. for refactors on software, the customer is the future software\ndeveloper: the KPI could be the throughput of that team.\nMaybe for an internal reporting tool, the customer is the project\nmanager, and the KPI is their time spent searching for relevant data.\n3. Tasking the Project\nTasking projects help in the same way that a six page paper proposal\ndoes: clarifying the approach.\nEach task in the project should be clear in purpose, and end result. Even small tasks should\nhave some measure of success (although not as rigorous as the larger project KPI)\n"},"opinion/webservice_cid_pattern.html":{"url":"opinion/webservice_cid_pattern.html","title":"Webservice Cid Pattern","keywords":"","body":"CID: Consumer-Internal-Datasource\nThe CID pattern introduces a general code organization scheme,\ndesgined to protect and encapsulate common changes to code:\n\nchange to an interface, to provide compatability. (Consumer)\nchanges to the datatstore, for performance or architecture. (Datasource)\nchange to behaviour, which is typically agnostic from interface or data storage (Internal)\n\nThese are the three layers: consumer, internal, and datasource. Thus, the pattern is named CID.\nCID is good for design\nEach layer represents the mindset to have, when considering the design\nof that layer. It is true that many changes affect the whole\nstack. However, the abstraction is still very important for\nrefactoring.\nDesign for the Consumer\nDesigning for the consumer is thinking about the user interaction. How\ndoes the user best interact with your application? How can I ensure the user only\nsees the complexity they need to say?\nDesign for the Datasource\nDesigning the datasource is mainly about performance and\ncorrectness. How can I ensure an operation is performed efficiently?\nHow can I ensure that data integrity is preserved?\nDesign for the Internal\nDesigning interally is a lot about code organization and\narchitecture. There are no hard and fast rules about any of the\nlayers, but the internal definitons are very loose.\nCID is good for refactoring\nChanging datasources entirely\nSince the interface and expectations are well abstracted, switching\ndatasources comes down to building functions that can directly replace\nthan functonality.\nChanging interfaces (e.g. http to grpc)\nAs the interfaces are abstracted from the internal representation,\nsupported a new interface type becomes:\n\nwrite a converter to and from the internal represention to the new interface\nadd the interface to your code.\n\nThat's it! The interface function should also be trivial, since it's a\nmatter of converting to and from the interface you're targetting.\nCID and data structures\nIn an ideal CID pattern, there is only one datastructure or object per\nconcept. Concerns like multiple versions of the interface is delegated\nto the interface layer, while anything specific to the datasource\n(e.g.  denormalizing data to ensure faster queries) should be\nencapsulated in the datasource.\nBy following this rule, the internal code becomes a clean description\nof the behavior of the service itself.\n"},"opinion/work.html":{"url":"opinion/work.html","title":"Work","keywords":"","body":"Different Types of Work\nas referenced in The Phoenix Project,\nthere are multiple different kinds of work that a team does.

Using the  common KPIs  for SRE's\nworks great as KPIs here:\n\nMTBF (Mean Time Between Failure): mean time between issues in production\nMTTR (Mean Time To Recovery): time to recover from an issue, once discovered\nMTTD (Mean Time To Detection): time to find that an issue exists\n\nHow does testing affect these KPIS?\nMTBF\nIf bugs are caught before they are shipped, then that is a failure\nthat does not ship to production. Assume that all regressions come\nin at some frequency N. If we increase the likelyhood of finding bugs in test\nby 10%, then or frequency reduces to 0.9N.\nMTBF = 1 / N.

But for a lot of products, it is. For a lot of fullstack tests,\n100% success rates are not reasonable.\nFor example, let's consider a web-based product with three components:\n\nThe front-end UI\nThe back-end service\nThe database\n\nThere's also other components in play that aren't directly related to\nthe product:\n\nnetwork\n\nLet's say that, individually, each component guarantees 99.9% success\nrate when utilized. Now, when combined, the probability of a request\nfailing is 1 - the probability of all services succeeding:\n1 - 0.999^4 ~= 0.996\nGiven the current guarantees, a test against the product will fail 4 /\n1000 times. If we start adding in other dependent components (an\nanalytics service, a third party service), the numbers become\nworse. If we had 10 components at 99.9% success rate, we end up with:\n1 - 0.999^10 ~= 0.99\n1 out of every 100 test executions will fail. And it will not indicate\na functional failure: each service is running within it's\nspecifications.\nIn addition, these test are often performed in test environments,\nwhich often don't have nearly the same guarantees as a production environment.\nThus, it's reasonable to expect that these will fail, at least a small\npercentage of the time. In situations like these, it's best to take a\nrunning average and detect large fluctuations, rather than require a\n100% pass rate. This is much easier to achieve on smaller tests such as\nUI, integration, and unit tests.\nFullstack tests are the least valuable test\nIn the section about cost, we talk about what increases and decreases\nthe value of tests. If you look at the value, fullstack tests are the\nleast valuable of all the tests.\nFullstack tests are slow, due to requiring setup and teardown of a\nlarger amount of state, and the number of steps required to fully perform\nthe test tend to be higher.\nFullstack tests are inconsistent, due to the number of components that\ncould be failing, multiplying the number of failures.\nFullstack tests are expensive to maintain, due to the constantly\nchanging component behaviour, and the upkeep of the components of the\nproduct.\nFullstack tests require utilization of multiple resources, due to the way it must\npropagate back and forth throughout the components.\nIt it is true that fullstack tests provide a lot of coverage. However,\nwhen weighed against the increased expenses to execute and maintain\nthe test, investment in better testing of the isolated components is a\nbetter use of people power.\nFullstack tests are necessary\nAll of the above doesn't change the fact that fullstack tests do test\na vital part of the product that is not tested by the isolated\ntests. Fullstack tests test the integration of all the components\ntogether. Thus, choosing to omit fullstack tests entirely will lead\nto a dangerous gap in coverage.\nBut keep the count small\nUltimately, the actual area of coverage of a fullstack that could not\nbe potentially covered by a more isolated test is very small.

Based on that study, 2/3rds of projects executed do not\nhave the desired effect, and may not have any effect. Thus, choosing the\nright project to deliver is important.\nMean Time To Delivery of Functionality\nMean time to delivery is the amoutn of time it takes to deliver\nfunctionality. It would be best to measure it as the amount of time\nfrom when work is started on the task, to when it is delivered.\nMeasuring from time when it is requested is a fallacy, as the amount\nof work your team has in the queue can impact this. Time in queue (and\nvalue of projects in queue) is a better KPI for whether more resources\nshould be allocated to the team.\nMean Availability\nIn this case, availability is defined as the total amount of time your\nsoftware is providing value to your users, vs the total amount of time\nthat value is desired. If there is a point in time where a user wants\nto extract value (e.g. use your application), and your software is\nunavailable or unable to provide that value, that negatively impacts\nthis KPI.\nImproving Project Choice\nSee the Lean Startup.\nImproving the Pipeline, and ensure high mean availability\nAssuming optimal project choice, the next item to optimize is the\ndelivery of software.\n\nProject Begins\nWrite Code\n?\nProject Delivered\n\nIn order to measure if the project delivery was\nsuccessful, it's important to define the project to a point that\nacceptance criteria can be outlined about the functonality and\navailability of the project.\nWe'll define a project as delivered when:\n\nall acceptance criteria has been met\nthe project is available to all desired customers\n\nThe delivery of code to customers is typically called deploy:\n\nProject Begins\nWrite Code\n?\nProject Satisfies Acceptance Criteria\nDeploy\nProject Delivered\n\nTo ensure that mean availability remains high, the acceptance criteria\nmust be validated BEFORE the deploy. To ensure this, there must be a\ncomprehensive execution of acceptance tests performed:\n\nProject Begins\nWrite Code\n?\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\nProjects Delivered\n\nAt this point, the pipeline could be considered\ncomplete. Unfortunately, it is often the case that code does not pass\nall acceptance criteria upon Write. Thus, the cycle looks something like:\n\nWrite Code\nRun Acceptance Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Acceptance Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\n\nThus, the speed of the pre-deploy cycle is significantly more\nimportant than the speed of the deploy itself. Acceptance criteria\ntends to require full test environments or more test fixtures, and\nthere are much cheaper alternatives, like unit testing. Thus, it makes\nsense to introduce unit testing as a much cheaper way of providing\nfeedback:\n\nWrite Code\nRun Unit Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Unit Tests\nRun Acceptance Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Unit Tests\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\n\nIf we assume that we saved even a single acceptance test run by a unit test, then you break even when:\nacceptance_time * num_times > acceptance_time * (num_times - 1) + unit_time * num_times\nacceptance_time > unit_time * num_times\nacceptance_time / num_times > unit_time\nSo, if your average pass includes running 5 acceptance passes, then\nyou will save time if your unit tests take 1 / 5th of acceptance time.\nIn practice, you save many times that amount, as one iterates rapidly\non unit tests, and ends with a single execution or two of acceptance\ntests. If we assume:\n\nacceptance_time = 10 (min)\nunit_time = 1 (min)\nnum_times = 5\n\nThen the time savings is:\nwith only acceptance: 5 * 10 = 50 minutes\nwith unit tests, 1 failed acceptance run: 2 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 25 minutes\nwith unit tests, 0 failed acceptance run: 2 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 15 minutes\nThe savings on the pipeline is over 50 percent! In practice, unit\ntests are much, much faster than acceptance tests, and the iteration\ncycle can be far more than 5 times, so higher yields are not unusual.\nThus, a bare-minimum software delivery pipeline looks like:\n\nWrite Code\nRun Unit Tests\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\n\nMaking this loop more efficient is a matter of seeing where tooling or\npractices can be applied to provide an objective improvement. This is\na kind of product design of it's own, and could benefit from the lean\nstartup assumption validation framework.\nA common pattern comes in automation: a majority of this pipeline can\nbe automated:\n\nWrite Code\n(Automated) Run Unit Tests\n(Automated) Run Acceptance Test\n(Automated) Deploy\n\nThe goal is to ensure that developers are dedicating as much time as\npossible to creating value.
