Since these are not backed up by evidence, I put them in the\npinion section until it meets or fails the same rigor as the other\nsections.\nMany of these ideas are not mine. Some are. I'll point to the source\nif I got it from one.\nAny and all of these ideas are up for scrutiny. If you disagree and a\nfactual or logical basis, I'd love to hear from you: file an issue, or\nPR.\nYou can file issus about your opinions too, but facts and logic win\nout.\n"},"monitoring/monitoring.html":{"url":"monitoring/monitoring.html","title":"Monitoring","keywords":"","body":"Monitoring\nCurrently more or less a sandbox page, mainly to gather my thoughts.\n"},"monitoring/histogram_no_p99.html":{"url":"monitoring/histogram_no_p99.html","title":"Histogram No P 99","keywords":"","body":"Use histograms, not p99.\nWhat is pXX?\npXX (e.g. p50, p95, p99) is a measurement system that defines the boundary at which that a particular percentage of data points fit within that threshold.\nFor example, p95 for max latency represents the latency at which 95% of traffic is below.\nWhat is a histogram?\nA histogram is a concept in monitoring that buckets a data point into a predefined set of buckets. For example, all latency requests could be categorized in a buckets of:\n\n\n100 \n300 \n1s \n10s \n\nWhy are histograms better than pXX?\nHistograms can be aggregated\npXX metrics are percentiles, which mean that there's no reasonable way to aggregate those data points. The strategies available to you are inaccurate, in one way or the other.\n\nweighted average: weighted average does not handle anomalies properly\n\nHistograms can be aggregated across multiple data sources easily: just sum!\nThis property alone makes pXX a bad choice for monitoring systems. There is no way to subdivide your monitoring and aggregate: getting an accurate p99 means creating a system than ingests EVERY SINGLE data point at a single source.\nHistograms give better context to the \"shape\" of traffic.\nAny percentile loses granularity into the actual behavior of the users. The following situations result in equivalent p99:\n\n98 1ms, 1 1s, 1 10s\n98 900ms, 1 1s, 1 10s\n\nStoring histograms in memory is cheap\nHistograms are simply points aggregated into buckets: it can be representing with a single hashmap of  pairs. The calculation to add a metric is also just incrementing a value in a hashmap. If you wanted to optimize even more, you could store it as an array and reduce operations on the cpu.\nAny programming language can implement this quickly. p9x requires storing all data points, or using an algorithm to effectively guess at the accurate value.\nHow to build good histograms\nHistograms require something pXX doesn't: choosing good boundaries beforehand, and also number of boundaries. Let's talk about these issues separately.\nChoosing Good Boundaries\nBoundaries are best when they are meaningful: there is a real impact on an aspect of your service that you care about. For example, let's look at latency as an example. Latency has a few core points:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2017/03/17/how-to-compete-for-consumers-online-while-attention-spans-diminish/#599dc1146667\nHow many Boundaries\nThis question is less important. Most metrics storage systems worth their salt can store millions of metrics, so the number is really a matter of what makes sense from a business perspective.\nMore Reading\n\nhttps://www.wavefront.com/why-histograms-critical-for-reporting-hi-velocity-metrics/\n\n"},"monitoring/sandbox_2.html":{"url":"monitoring/sandbox_2.html","title":"Sandbox 2","keywords":"","body":"A top-down philosophy on alerting\nWhat is an alert, and what is it good for?\nAlerts are a way to be notified automatically of a situation that requires human action. Alerts are composed of:\n\na monitor: a way to observe data that could signify the need for human intervention\na criteria: a way to analyst the data to determine if human intervention is needed\n\nWhen is human judgement necessary?\nWhen there's a massive change in service behavior?\nA change in service behavior could signify either a system behaving incorrectly,\nor a system that is now experiencing an abnormal situation.\nAbnormal situations could become the new normal with little fanfare. But,\nabnormal situations might require human intervention to handle as well (e.g.\n  someone increases load 10x)\nIf a system is architected in such a way that it can scale with load, then\nit just becomes a matter of scaling relative to the demands of the service.\nscaling hardware becomes a matter of cost. The ultimate decision maker should\nbe the person responsible for deciding if the budget of the system is reasonable or not.\n200 counts are only a problem if the usage is \"too high.\" What is too high?\n\nthe system becomes close to approaching a cliff (eventual resolution)\nthe system is too costly (eventual resolution)\nthe system is falling off a cliff (immediate resolution)\n\nAlert Priorities\nThere are three major priorities to alerts:\n\nalerts that must be investigated now\nalerts that must be investigated soon\nalerts that must be investigated eventually\n\nIn either situation, they must be investigated. The alerts\nthat need to be investigated in the future could be batched and investigated separately.\nAlerts that need to be investigated now\nAKA: Excuse me from the dinner table\nNotification Strategy: Page\n\nuser impact below SLA\n\nExamples:\n\nsystem unavailable\n\nAlerts that must be investigated soon\nAKA: I'll look after dinner\nNotification Strategy:\n\nPage during business hours\nPage lower priority off-hours (with specification that this is a \"soon\")\n\nlikely user impact impending\n\n\nExamples:\n\nhost down?\n\nWhy should we differentiate between this and \"now\"?\nBecause soon and now are a huge quality of life difference. This is a human comfort threshold more than it is a threshold about system operations.\nAlerts that must be investigated eventually\nAKA: I'll look at it on Monday\nNotification Strategy: E-mail, or no notification. Separate dashboard\nCould be batches together for a single investigation with others, saving time from context switching.\n\nno likely user impact, or minimal user impact\n\nExamples:\n\nsingle 500s error\nhigh 200s\n\nWho should investigate these alerts?\nEach of these categories require investigation. The question is who.\nFor Now + Soon, we need fast responses. Fast responses can cause significant fatigue,\n so it's important to share the burden on these. So, on-call rotation\nFor eventually, we're talking about someone looks at the situation periodically,\nand makes judgements based off of that. We could assign it to a single person responsible for quality, or share that burden as well.\nAlert Types\nBusiness SLA\nA business SLA reflects a critical business metric.

But for a lot of products, it is.

Now, when combined, the probability of a request\nfailing is 1 - the probability of all services succeeding:\n1 - 0.999^4 ~= 0.996\nGiven the current guarantees, a test against the product will fail 4 /\n1000 times. If we start adding in other dependent components (an\nanalytics service, a third party service), the numbers become\nworse.

However,\nwhen weighed against the increased expenses to execute and maintain\nthe test, investment in better testing of the isolated components is a\nbetter use of people power.\nFullstack tests are necessary\nAll of the above doesn't change the fact that fullstack tests do test\na vital part of the product that is not tested by the isolated\ntests. Fullstack tests test the integration of all the components\ntogether. Thus, choosing to omit fullstack tests entirely will lead\nto a dangerous gap in coverage.\nBut keep the count small\nUltimately, the actual area of coverage of a fullstack that could not\nbe potentially covered by a more isolated test is very small. As such,\nit's best to keep the number of fullstack tests small.\nThese are expandend on in the 'patterns' part of the book, but some\ngood guidelines are:\n\ndon't test variations in component behaviour in the fullstack tests\n\n"},"z_sandbox/keep_tests_small.html":{"url":"z_sandbox/keep_tests_small.html","title":"Keep Tests Small","keywords":"","body":"Keep your tests fast\nThe amount of time it takes to run a test can be one of the hidden\ncosts sorrounding testing.

Someone who will have no understanding of how your\nproduct works, and only interacts with it via regulated experiences\nthat you dictate.\nTo ensure shipping a quality product, it's important to test this area\nas well. However, UI testing can be more complex than testing code\ndirectly: you must have some mechanism by which to automate user\ninteraction.\nUI Tests are not Full Stack Tests\nA common misconception surrounding UI tests is that they need to\ninteract with the full stack. Although it is possible to test the full\nstack while testing UI, this is not necessary, and can ofter lead to\ninconsistent results on what should be very consistent,\nstraightforward tests.\nWhy UI Tests are 'Flakey'\nInconsistency (commonly refered to as flakey) is a term that is\nassociated with UI tests often. Inconsistency can be avoided by\nfollowing the same basic tenants that one would with unit testing:\n\nstubbing dependencies that can have inconsistent results\nweb services\ndatabases\n\n\nkeeping the validation small\ndon't test multi-step workflows in one test\n\n\n\nInconsistent UI tests tend to have the same symptoms as bad unit tests:\nmaking multiple assumptions on the existing state, and following complex workflows\nthat require multiple steps.\nThere are strong corollaries between UI tests and unit tests for a\nreason: because UI tests are another form of unit testing.\nSee the 'isolating UI' pattern for more information on how to keep UI\ntests small.\n"},"01_high_level.html":{"url":"01_high_level.html","title":"01 High Level","keywords":"","body":"High Level: The 1000 foot view on software engineering\n\nThe ultimate goal of software is to provide value\nThe most efficient software teams are those that provide the most\nvalue to the customer. There are three core KPIs for providing user\nvalue:\nChoosing the right projects\n1/3rd of projects measured against a KPI actually improved the KPI\nwhen release. Based on that study, 2/3rds of projects executed do not\nhave the desired effect, and may not have any effect. Thus, choosing the\nright project to deliver is important.\nMean Time To Delivery of Functionality\nMean time to delivery is the amoutn of time it takes to deliver\nfunctionality. It would be best to measure it as the amount of time\nfrom when work is started on the task, to when it is delivered.\nMeasuring from time when it is requested is a fallacy, as the amount\nof work your team has in the queue can impact this. Time in queue (and\nvalue of projects in queue) is a better KPI for whether more resources\nshould be allocated to the team.\nMean Availability\nIn this case, availability is defined as the total amount of time your\nsoftware is providing value to your users, vs the total amount of time\nthat value is desired. If there is a point in time where a user wants\nto extract value (e.g. use your application), and your software is\nunavailable or unable to provide that value, that negatively impacts\nthis KPI.\nImproving Project Choice\nSee the Lean Startup.\nImproving the Pipeline, and ensure high mean availability\nAssuming optimal project choice, the next item to optimize is the\ndelivery of software.\n\nProject Begins\nWrite Code\n?\nProject Delivered\n\nIn order to measure if the project delivery was\nsuccessful, it's important to define the project to a point that\nacceptance criteria can be outlined about the functonality and\navailability of the project.\nWe'll define a project as delivered when:\n\nall acceptance criteria has been met\nthe project is available to all desired customers\n\nThe delivery of code to customers is typically called deploy:\n\nProject Begins\nWrite Code\n?\nProject Satisfies Acceptance Criteria\nDeploy\nProject Delivered\n\nTo ensure that mean availability remains high, the acceptance criteria\nmust be validated BEFORE the deploy. To ensure this, there must be a\ncomprehensive execution of acceptance tests performed:\n\nProject Begins\nWrite Code\n?\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\nProjects Delivered\n\nAt this point, the pipeline could be considered\ncomplete. Unfortunately, it is often the case that code does not pass\nall acceptance criteria upon Write. Thus, the cycle looks something like:\n\nWrite Code\nRun Acceptance Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Acceptance Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\n\nThus, the speed of the pre-deploy cycle is significantly more\nimportant than the speed of the deploy itself. Acceptance criteria\ntends to require full test environments or more test fixtures, and\nthere are much cheaper alternatives, like unit testing. Thus, it makes\nsense to introduce unit testing as a much cheaper way of providing\nfeedback:\n\nWrite Code\nRun Unit Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Unit Tests\nRun Acceptance Tests\nFailed, Write Code\nRun Unit Tests\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\n\nIf we assume that we saved even a single acceptance test run by a unit test, then you break even when:\nacceptance_time * num_times > acceptance_time * (num_times - 1) + unit_time * num_times\nacceptance_time > unit_time * num_times\nacceptance_time / num_times > unit_time\nSo, if your average pass includes running 5 acceptance passes, then\nyou will save time if your unit tests take 1 / 5th of acceptance time.\nIn practice, you save many times that amount, as one iterates rapidly\non unit tests, and ends with a single execution or two of acceptance\ntests. If we assume:\n\nacceptance_time = 10 (min)\nunit_time = 1 (min)\nnum_times = 5\n\nThen the time savings is:\nwith only acceptance: 5 * 10 = 50 minutes\nwith unit tests, 1 failed acceptance run: 2 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 25 minutes\nwith unit tests, 0 failed acceptance run: 2 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 15 minutes\nThe savings on the pipeline is over 50 percent! In practice, unit\ntests are much, much faster than acceptance tests, and the iteration\ncycle can be far more than 5 times, so higher yields are not unusual.\nThus, a bare-minimum software delivery pipeline looks like:\n\nWrite Code\nRun Unit Tests\nRun Acceptance Tests\nDeploy\n\nMaking this loop more efficient is a matter of seeing where tooling or\npractices can be applied to provide an objective improvement. This is\na kind of product design of it's own, and could benefit from the lean\nstartup assumption validation framework.\nA common pattern comes in automation: a majority of this pipeline can\nbe automated:\n\nWrite Code\n(Automated) Run Unit Tests\n(Automated) Run Acceptance Test\n(Automated) Deploy\n\nThe goal is to ensure that developers are dedicating as much time as\npossible to creating value. This is done by meticulously identifying\nautomatable tasks, and automating them.\nThis basically amounts to the philosophies of continous delivery.\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"CONTRIBUTING","keywords":"","body":"building it yourself\nhttps://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook is used for publishing.
