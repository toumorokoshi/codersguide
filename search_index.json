When working in\nan environment that emphasizes rapid development, it's important to\nget feedback as soon as possible. Shorter tests provide feedback more\nquickly than slower tests. The slower a test is, the more likely it is\nto run in a process that is farther removed from a developer's\nstandard development process.\nOne can also execute shorter tests far more rapidly that larger\ntests. For example, let's say that, on average:\n\na unit test takes 1ms\nan integration test takes 100ms\na full-stack tests\n\nWhat costs are associated with a test?\n\nmaintenance cost\ntime to execute\nresources consumed during execution\n\n"},"z_sandbox/forward.html":{"url":"z_sandbox/forward.html","title":"Forward","keywords":"","body":"Forward\nEach chapter is this book is written to be a tool that a test engineer\n(or developer) can use to approach the difficult task of testing.\nTesting, like programming, is a fairly open-ended practice: one can\nchoose to be rigerous, planning out every detail, or can be abstract,\nusing intuition and nuance to approach the day-to-day issues that arise\nduring real-world testing.\nWhen dealing with a world of ever-changing testing requirements,\nbusiness concerns, and shifting features, it can be very easy to rely\non our intuition completely. The unfortunate truth is that our\nintuition can often be wrong. Many times, having the ability to\nquantify our testing, and qualify what sort of coverage is most\nvaluable, tends to be a much better approach. We should divert our\ncreative mind power toward solving the more challenging problems\nrevolving around testing, such as the technical hurdles toward\nautomation, and leave the rote act of determining what to test and\nwhat it costs to more solidied processes.\nMy goal with this book is to not argue about ideologies. Instead, I\njust want to present facts. Then, I want to build upon those facts,\nand prove other facts.

Please refer to\nthe ui testing section to find out why.\nFullstack testing refers specifically to tests which test the full\ninfrastructure of a product. Examples include:\n\na web service, including the UI, back-end server, and database\ninteraction\na desktop product, including the UI, any local filestorage\ninteraction, and network interaction.\n\nFullstack tests will not pass 100%\nThat's not necessarily true. But for a lot of products, it is. For a lot of fullstack tests,\n100% success rates are not reasonable.\nFor example, let's consider a web-based product with three components:\n\nThe front-end UI\nThe back-end service\nThe database\n\nThere's also other components in play that aren't directly related to\nthe product:\n\nnetwork\n\nLet's say that, individually, each component guarantees 99.9% success\nrate when utilized. Now, when combined, the probability of a request\nfailing is 1 - the probability of all services succeeding:\n1 - 0.999^4 ~= 0.996\nGiven the current guarantees, a test against the product will fail 4 /\n1000 times. If we start adding in other dependent components (an\nanalytics service, a third party service), the numbers become\nworse. If we had 10 components at 99.9% success rate, we end up with:\n1 - 0.999^10 ~= 0.99\n1 out of every 100 test executions will fail. And it will not indicate\na functional failure: each service is running within it's\nspecifications.\nIn addition, these test are often performed in test environments,\nwhich often don't have nearly the same guarantees as a production environment.\nThus, it's reasonable to expect that these will fail, at least a small\npercentage of the time. In situations like these, it's best to take a\nrunning average and detect large fluctuations, rather than require a\n100% pass rate. This is much easier to achieve on smaller tests such as\nUI, integration, and unit tests.\nFullstack tests are the least valuable test\nIn the section about cost, we talk about what increases and decreases\nthe value of tests. If you look at the value, fullstack tests are the\nleast valuable of all the tests.\nFullstack tests are slow, due to requiring setup and teardown of a\nlarger amount of state, and the number of steps required to fully perform\nthe test tend to be higher.\nFullstack tests are inconsistent, due to the number of components that\ncould be failing, multiplying the number of failures.\nFullstack tests are expensive to maintain, due to the constantly\nchanging component behaviour, and the upkeep of the components of the\nproduct.\nFullstack tests require utilization of multiple resources, due to the way it must\npropagate back and forth throughout the components.\nIt it is true that fullstack tests provide a lot of coverage. However,\nwhen weighed against the increased expenses to execute and maintain\nthe test, investment in better testing of the isolated components is a\nbetter use of people power.\nFullstack tests are necessary\nAll of the above doesn't change the fact that fullstack tests do test\na vital part of the product that is not tested by the isolated\ntests. Fullstack tests test the integration of all the components\ntogether. Thus, choosing to omit fullstack tests entirely will lead\nto a dangerous gap in coverage.\nBut keep the count small\nUltimately, the actual area of coverage of a fullstack that could not\nbe potentially covered by a more isolated test is very small. As such,\nit's best to keep the number of fullstack tests small.\nThese are expandend on in the 'patterns' part of the book, but some\ngood guidelines are:\n\ndon't test variations in component behaviour in the fullstack tests\n\n"},"z_sandbox/keep_tests_small.html":{"url":"z_sandbox/keep_tests_small.html","title":"Keep Tests Small","keywords":"","body":"Keep your tests fast\nThe amount of time it takes to run a test can be one of the hidden\ncosts sorrounding testing.

However, UI testing can be more complex than testing code\ndirectly: you must have some mechanism by which to automate user\ninteraction.\nUI Tests are not Full Stack Tests\nA common misconception surrounding UI tests is that they need to\ninteract with the full stack. Although it is possible to test the full\nstack while testing UI, this is not necessary, and can ofter lead to\ninconsistent results on what should be very consistent,\nstraightforward tests.\nWhy UI Tests are 'Flakey'\nInconsistency (commonly refered to as flakey) is a term that is\nassociated with UI tests often. Inconsistency can be avoided by\nfollowing the same basic tenants that one would with unit testing:\n\nstubbing dependencies that can have inconsistent results\nweb services\ndatabases\n\n\nkeeping the validation small\ndon't test multi-step workflows in one test\n\n\n\nInconsistent UI tests tend to have the same symptoms as bad unit tests:\nmaking multiple assumptions on the existing state, and following complex workflows\nthat require multiple steps.\nThere are strong corollaries between UI tests and unit tests for a\nreason: because UI tests are another form of unit testing.\nSee the 'isolating UI' pattern for more information on how to keep UI\ntests small.\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"CONTRIBUTING","keywords":"","body":"building it yourself\nhttps://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook is used for publishing.
