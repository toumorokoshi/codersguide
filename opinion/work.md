as referenced in [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988262592/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0988262592&linkCode=as2&tag=yusuketsutsum-20&linkId=0e6333fc68a16a0b08f01908f8eced5b),

there are multiple different kinds of work that a team does. I'm
omitting a category (changes) for now, as it's effectively encompassed within the other categories.

The three are categorized as:

## Feature work

work that directly benefits the business

## Infrastructure Work

work that indirectly benefits the business (e.g. improving the existing process, to enable
more feature work)

## Unplanned Work

Incidents and outages that are not planned.
