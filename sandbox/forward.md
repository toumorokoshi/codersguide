Each chapter is this book is written to be a tool that a test engineer
(or developer) can use to approach the difficult task of testing.

Testing, like programming, is a fairly open-ended practice: one can
choose to be rigerous, planning out every detail, or can be abstract,
using intuition and nuance to approach the day-to-day issues that arise
during real-world testing.

When dealing with a world of ever-changing testing requirements,
business concerns, and shifting features, it can be very easy to rely
on our intuition completely. The unfortunate truth is that our
intuition can often be wrong. Many times, having the ability to
quantify our testing, and qualify what sort of coverage is most
valuable, tends to be a much better approach. We should divert our
creative mind power toward solving the more challenging problems
revolving around testing, such as the technical hurdles toward
automation, and leave the rote act of determining what to test and
what it costs to more solidied processes.

My goal with this book is to not argue about ideologies. Instead, I
just want to present facts. Then, I want to build upon those facts,
and prove other facts. At the end of the day, My goal is to prove the
following:

* Small, fast tests provide much more value than larger tests
*
